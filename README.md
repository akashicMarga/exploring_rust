**Exploratory Rust Repository**

Welcome to my exploratory repository! Here, I'm keeping track of my learning journey through the Rust ecosystem. This repository serves as a playground for various small projects that I will be creating while exploring different technologies and concepts in Rust. 

## Note to self
The main goal of this repository is to document my learning process and experimentation with different technologies related to Deep Learning, Vector Databases, Data Pipeline, Computing on Edge Devices, Metal GPU, WebGPU, WebAssembly, CUDA, and Cross-compiled Apps. Also, its pretty hectic to maintain different repos for different projects and everything is at one place then i can look back anytime if i need an idea about the code, syntax and approach. Most of my previous work has been lost somehwere like n number of untitled.ipynb and other small projects. 

## What to Expect
In this repository, you'll find a diverse range of projects, each focusing on a specific aspect of the aforementioned technologies which may increase as something new comes up or drives my curiosity over web. These projects might vary in complexity, ranging from simple demonstrations to more elaborate implementations. I am creating it as a helper repo for myself to look book back whenever I forget any concept or it's applied implementation.
